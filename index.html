<h2 class="titles">Prominent Achievements:</h2>

 <li><span class="inv-title" >AC Power Transmission System:</span> Tesla's alternating current system revolutionized electrical power distribution, making it possible to generate electricity centrally and transmit it efficiently over long distances.</li>

<li><span class="inv-title" >Tesla Coil and Wireless Energy Transfer:</span> The Tesla coil allowed for the generation of high-voltage, low-current electricity and paved the way for wireless energy transmission technologies.</li>

<li><span class="inv-title" >Remote Control and Robotics:</span> Tesla demonstrated the first remote-controlled model boat and envisioned the use of radio waves for remote control and automation, which has since become a critical technology.</li>
